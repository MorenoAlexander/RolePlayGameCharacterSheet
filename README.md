# RolePlayGameCharacterSheet
Role play game character sheet (RPGCS) is a work in progress project that would allow users to manage character sheets 
for role play adventure games like Dungeons & Dragons, or Pathfinder.

The software would allow users to define how their characters level up, how skills or talents affect their character, and allow them to keep track of items in their inventory. No game rules are predefined, this allows for flexibility for any role play game.

More info will be placed here once the first working release is completed.
Estimated release: 2019
